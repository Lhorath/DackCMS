# @description This file handles URL rewriting for clean URLs, improves
#              security by blocking access to sensitive files, and sets
#              core server options for the application. All public
#              requests are routed through this file.

#===================================================================
# SECTION 1: CORE SERVER CONFIGURATION
#===================================================================

# Disable server-generated directory listings for security.
# This prevents visitors from seeing a list of files in directories
# that do not have an index file.
Options -Indexes


#===================================================================
# SECTION 2: URL REWRITING ENGINE
#===================================================================
# This section enables the clean URL functionality. It rewrites all
# non-file and non-directory requests to the main index.php file,
# which then handles the routing internally.

# Turn on the URL rewriting engine.
RewriteEngine On

# Conditions: Do not apply the rewrite rule if the request is for
# an existing file (-f) or an existing directory (-d). This allows
# direct access to assets like CSS files, images, and scripts.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# The Rewrite Rule:
# Captures the entire requested URL path (.*) and passes it as a 'url'
# query parameter to index.php.
# [L]   - Last rule. Stops processing further rewrite rules.
# [QSA] - Query String Append. Preserves any existing query string.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [L,QSA]


#===================================================================
# SECTION 3: SECURITY DIRECTIVES
#===================================================================
# These rules enhance security by explicitly denying web access to
# critical or sensitive files.

# Deny access to this .htaccess file itself.
<Files .htaccess>
    Require all denied
</Files>

# Deny direct browser access to the main configuration file.
<Files config.php>
    Require all denied
</Files>
